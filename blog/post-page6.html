    <p class="post-text">Maintaining a well-stocked and healthy pantry is the foundation of a nutritious and delicious diet. As someone who's passionate about food and wellness, I've learned the importance of having a pantry that's filled with wholesome ingredients. In this ultimate guide, I'll walk you through the essentials for stocking a pantry that supports your health and culinary adventures.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Grains and Legumes</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat pasta are excellent sources of complex carbohydrates and fiber. Add a variety of legumes, such as lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, for protein and fiber. These staples are versatile and can be the basis for countless healthy meals.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Canned Goods</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Canned goods can be a lifesaver when you need a quick and nutritious meal. Opt for canned vegetables, tomatoes, and beans with no added salt or sugar. Tuna, salmon, and sardines in cans or pouches are great sources of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Healthy Oils and Vinegars</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil are heart-healthy options for cooking and dressings. Keep a variety of vinegars on hand, like balsamic, apple cider, and rice vinegar, for adding flavor to dishes without excess salt or sugar.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Nuts and Seeds</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds, are packed with essential nutrients, healthy fats, and protein. They make for excellent snacks, add crunch to salads, and can be used in baking.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Spices and Herbs</h2>
    <p class="post-text">A well-stocked spice rack can transform your meals. Essential herbs and spices include garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, oregano, and paprika. These can add depth and flavor to your dishes without relying on excessive salt or artificial seasonings.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Low-Sodium Broths and Soups</h2>
    <p class="post-text">When you need a quick and comforting meal, low-sodium broths and soups are a great option. Look for options with real ingredients and fewer additives.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Whole-Grain Cereals and Snacks</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Whole-grain cereals and snacks can provide healthy options for breakfast and snacking. Choose items with minimal added sugars and artificial additives.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Nut Butter</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Peanut butter, almond butter, or other nut butters are excellent sources of protein and healthy fats. Be sure to pick natural varieties without added sugars and hydrogenated oils.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Whole-Grain Flour</h2>
    <p class="post-text">If you enjoy baking, stock whole-grain flours like whole wheat, almond, or coconut flour. These can be used to create healthier versions of your favorite baked goods.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Dried Fruits</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Dried fruits, like raisins, apricots, or cranberries, can satisfy your sweet tooth with natural sugars. They're also convenient for adding a burst of flavor to salads and oatmeal.</p>
